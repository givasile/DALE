\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Aggregated Local Effect (ALE) is a method for accurate estimation
  and visualization of feature effects, which overcomes fundamental
  failure modes of previously-existed methods, such as Partial
  Dependence Plots (PDP). The \textit{approximation} method of ALE,
  however, faces two crucial weaknesses. Firstly, it does not scale
  well in cases where the input has high dimensionality. Secondly, it
  is vulnerable to out-of-distribution sampling in cases with limited
  training examples. In this paper we propose a novel ALE
  approximation, called Differential Aggregated Local Effects (DALE),
  which overcomes these issues. Our proposal has significant
  computational advantages; Specifically, the computational complexity
  for computing the feature effect for all attributes using DALE is
  similar to what ALE requires for a single attribute. DALE,
  therefore, makes feature effect applicable to high-dimensional
  Machine Learning scenarios with near-zero computational
  overhead. Furthermore, unlike ALE, it calculates the feature effect
  using only the available samples, without creating artificial ones;
  This strategy resolves the weakness of misleading estimations due to
  out-of-distribution sampling. Experiments using both synthetic and
  real datasets demonstrate the value of the proposed approach. Code
  to reproduce these experiments will become publicly available upon
  acceptance.

\section{Method}

In this section, we present the DALE approximation;
In~\ref{sec:3-1-DALE}, we formulate the expression for the first and
second-order DALE, in~\ref{sec:3-2-computational} we explain its
computational benefits, in~\ref{sec:3-3-robustness} its robustness to
OOD sampling and, finally in~\ref{sec:3-4-std}, we quantify the
standard error of the DALE estimation.

\section{Experiments}

This section provides an experimental evaluation of DALE in
synthetic and real datasets. In the first part, we generate artificial
data points using a known generating distribution \(p(\mathcal{X}) \)
and a mapping \( f: \mathbf{X} \rightarrow Y \). The second part tests
our proposed method in a real dataset. In this case, we do not possess
ground truth information; threfore, we discuss the qualitative
differences between the two approximations. Code to reproduce the
experiments of this section will become publicly available upon
acceptance.
